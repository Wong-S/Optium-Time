## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Having trouble falling asleep? Optium Time is a sleep tracker app that helps the user wind down for bed. Once the user sets up an account and logs in, they can create a journal for that day, set an alarm for when they want to wake up, and search for ambient sounds to help them fall asleep. Users also can view a weekly average of how many hours of sleep they got, as well as view additional data about their sleep cycles and REM/NREM stages.
